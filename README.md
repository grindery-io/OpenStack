## 🧠 FAQ

### Why not just use a hosted LLM interface?
Hosted tools often lock you into one provider and don’t offer ownership or customization. OpenWebUI gives you full control and flexibility.

### Why OpenWebUI?
It’s the fastest-evolving open source UI for LLMs. Intuitive, extensible, and ideal for deploying custom agents, copilots, or internal tools.

### Can I bring my own models or vector DBs?
Yes. Everything is composable—LLM, inference provider, embedding model, vector store, and file loader.

### Can you deploy it inside our private network?
Absolutely. We support on-prem deployments with air-gapped options.
